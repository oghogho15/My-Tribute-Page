    		<h1>The accomplishments of Sir Fredrick Lugard</h1>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Frederick John Dealtry Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard <b>(1858-1945)</b>, was a British imperialist and colonial administrator in Africa. He made significant contributions to the theory and practice of the British colonial policy of indirect rule.</li>
    			<li>Frederick Lugard was born on <b>Jan. 22, 1858,</b> of missionary parents in India. He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, England. He obtained a commission in 1878 and returned to India, where he participated in the Afghan War of 1879-1880. In 1885 he accompanied the Indian contingent to the Sudan, joining the Suakin campaign to relieve Khartoum; in 1886 he joined military operations in Burma.</li>
    			<li>In <b>1887</b> Lugard returned to England, but unable to resume his commission for medical reasons and despairing over an unhappy love affair, he set out for the east coast of Africa. In 1888 he arrived in Mozambique, where he entered the employ of the African Lakes Company, for whom he commanded a mission to Lake Nyasa to relieve a trading station besieged by Arab slave traders.</li>
				<li>In <b>1906</b> Lugard resigned as high commissioner and the following year accepted an appointment as governor of Hong Kong, where he remained until 1911. Then, in 1912, he returned to Nigeria as of both the Northern and Southern protectorates, charged with amalgamating the two territories into a single unit.</li>
